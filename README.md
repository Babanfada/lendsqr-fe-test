Lendsqr-FE-Test
A React application built using Vite.js for the Lendsqr team.

Features
Three routes:
Login page/index route:https://ibrahim-muhammed-lendsqr-fe-test.vercel.app/
Users page: https://ibrahim-muhammed-lendsqr-fe-test.vercel.app/users
Users details page (nested route inside the users page):https://ibrahim-muhammed-lendsqr-fe-test.vercel.app/users/userdetails/id

The Login/index route  displays the login page and serves as the starting point for users.

The users page displays a list of users and their basic details, such as their name and email address.

The users details page can only be accessed by clicking on a user in the users page. This page displays detailed information about the selected user, including their address, phone number, and any other relevant details. The users details page is nested within the users page, meaning that it can only be accessed by first navigating to the users page.
